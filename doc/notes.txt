    technical note From:
        Andrei Shishlo, Jeff Holmes,

- The making of my tracking videos:
    1) generate a sequence of frames in PNG format with SIMULINAC/tracker.py
    2) import all frames into imageJ and create AVI video
    3) convert the AVI video on-line to MP4 (https://www.online-convert.com/)
    4) watch MP4 video with windows media player (works also well on android)
