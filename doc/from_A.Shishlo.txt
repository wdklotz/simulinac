About the examples. You are using examples/Linac/SNS_Linac directory. It is a place for old scripts that will be removed eventually. The new version of the linac package is examples/SNS_Linac. The read_me.txt there is explaining the situation. Here we have pyorbit_linac_model directory where is a script pyorbit_sns_linac_mebt_hebt2.py. I suggest to take a look at this script as an example for you. You will not need the whole linac, so redefine names as names=[“MEBT”,]. Then you can prepare the xml file describing your lattice and use it as your script for your linac. Or you can take a look at the lattice factory and prepare the script without xml file. The factory reads the xml file and construct the lattice from quads, rf gaps, and drifts. And for linac you will need sequences (or just one) and rf cavities that own the rf gaps (it could one gap in the cavity).
